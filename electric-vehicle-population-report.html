                    <p>This dashboard presents key performance indicators, including total vehicles, brands, and CAFV-eligible vehicles. It features a pie chart on vehicle eligibility, bar charts of the top 5 and bottom 5 brands by total vehicles, and a geo map displaying vehicle distribution across the US, Canada, and Alaska. </p>
                    <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
		    <p>
			This report provides a comprehensive analysis of key metrics within a dataset of 205,000 vehicles, categorized by brand, eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives, and vehicle type. After an extensive data-cleaning process in Excel, SQL was employed to manipulate the dataset and extract crucial insights, while Power BI was utilized to visualize the data for enhanced interpretation.

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>
                The dataset encompasses <b>42 brands</b>, with a total of <b>70,000 vehicles</b> classified as CAFV-eligible, representing <b>34.08%</b> of the total dataset. This highlights a significant penetration of clean energy vehicles within the market, aligning with broader industry trends towards sustainability and regulatory shifts favoring electric vehicles (EVs). <br />
		The analysis identified the <b>top five brands</b> by vehicle count as <b>Tesla, Chevrolet, Nissan, Ford, and Kia</b>, all of which are major players in the electric vehicle market. Tesla's dominance underscores its market leadership in both the BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) segments, driven by consumer demand for innovation and government incentives. <br />
		The <b>bottom five brands</b> in terms of vehicle presence—<b>Bentley, TH!NK, Azure Dynamics, Wheego Electric Cars, and Ram/Rolls-Royce</b>—reflect niche markets or lesser-known players in the EV space. Their lower sales volumes could be attributed to limited model offerings or higher price points. <br />
		In terms of vehicle type, the dataset contains <b>43,899 PHEVs</b> and <b>161,538 BEVs</b>, reinforcing the ongoing shift towards fully electric vehicles. The preference for BEVs aligns with industry projections as infrastructure improvements and longer-range capabilities boost consumer confidence. <br />

		<b>Geospatial Insights</b> <br />
		The geographic analysis, visualized through Power BI as bubble charts, reveals that the state with the highest concentration of electric vehicles is <b>Washington (WA)</b>. This is consistent with the state's progressive policies on EV adoption and infrastructure investments. Larger bubbles indicate states with a higher volume of vehicles, providing a visual snapshot of market saturation across the U.S. and Canada. <br />

		The findings of this report resonate with the current state of the EV market, which continues to experience rapid growth. Factors such as declining battery costs, government rebates, and the expansion of charging networks have all contributed to the increased adoption of electric vehicles. Additionally, the rising awareness of environmental concerns and stricter emissions regulations are further accelerating the shift towards clean transportation.
